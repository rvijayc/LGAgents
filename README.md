# Langraph Agents

Langraph Agents is my collection of langraph based agents to do various tasks - like querying a SQL database.

It uses a [forked version](https://github.com/rvijayc/AgentRun) of the [AgentRun](https://github.com/tjmlabs/AgentRun) repository that allows safe execution of Python code inside a Docker container.
